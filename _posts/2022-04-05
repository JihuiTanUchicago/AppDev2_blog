#Day 2

Learned Ruby through Ruby Koans.
Some interesting facts:
- ':' denotes type, like ':String'
- single quoted string do no interperet escapte characters
- '<<' could also be used for string concatenation, but it would modify the original string as well, if the original string is used for **assignment**.
